"P4P" is a mini boxing encyclopedia that was created using Java and SQL language. The mini boxing encyclopedia was filled with real-life facts coming from many real-life sources, most famously the "Ring" Magazine.

## "The Ring"

"The Ring" Magazine is considered by boxing enthusiasts to be the sport's most famous form of media. Since its creation in 1922, "The Ring" has been a staple for covering stories on elite prize fighters in and outside of the ring. The magazine is so respected, that it has its own championship belts which many legendary fighters have competed for. Starting 1989, the magazine began publishing a yearly ordered list of the ten best fighters in the world, regardless of weight class. The list was named the "Pound for Pound List" and retains the same relevance it did 35 years ago. The list generates great interest in fans, critics, as well fellow prize fighters. "The Ring" Magazine helped this project take a look back at history, as well as the present.
